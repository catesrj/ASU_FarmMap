## Route Map From Appalachian State University Main Campus to ASU Sustainable Devleopment Farm

This map map shows the route from the Appalachian State main campus to the ASU sustainable development farm. The main campus is located in Boone, NC, and the farm is located in Fleetwood, NC, approximately 25 minutes away from each other. I created this map because students trying to access the farm often have a difficult time finding it as they are not familiar with the area and itâ€™s down a gravel road. The reader is able to see the start and end points of the map as well as two land marks that may help them navigate the route, there is a gas station marked as you are leaving Boone and the exit off of the main road, 421. Libraries used were leaflet.js and leaflet.css. I sourced the data from google maps.
